    <p>Korean Fried Chicken. <strong>Crunchy, juicy fried battered chicken</strong>. A delicious, indulgent way to have chicken. Perfect with some beer or a carbonated drink.
        My Korean fried chicken recipe is easy to make and absolutely delicious! It does take some time but totally worth it! This way you can control what ingredients your using down to the type of oil.
        Usually in Korean culture, as an indulgent treat, they will have some fried chicken with beer. They call this pairing of fried chicken and beer "Chimaek". Chikin, meaning 'fried chicken', and maekju, meaning 'beer'.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 chicken drumsticks</li>
        <li>4 cups cooking oil (I use avocado oil)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Chicken Marinade</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp dry sherry or white wine</li>
        <li>¼ tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1.5 tsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp garlic minced</li>
        <li>½ tsp salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Korean Fried Chicken Batter</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2.5 cups tapioca flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp onion powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>3 tsp curry powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>½ tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cup water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, mix together your marinade ingredients. Marinate your chicken for 5-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in another large mixing bowl, mix together your batter ingredients until you have a thick but running batter. The batter will settle and almost "solidify" but that is normal. You will just need to mix it again when you're ready to batter the chicken.</li>
        <li>Once your chicken has marinated, add it to your batter and mix. You'll need some arm strength here to evenly coat the chicken.</li>
        <li>Heat your cooking oil in a pot over medium heat. Place a wooden chopstick in the oil to check if the oil is hot enough by looking for bubbles. Once you see bubbles form at the tip of the chopstick, your oil is hot enough.</li>
        <li>Carefully place battered chicken into hot oil. The batter will run off the chicken a bit but that's normal. Do not overcrowd the pot or cover your pot with a lid.</li>
        <li>Cook your drumsticks for 10 minutes on both sides (20 minutes in total), flipping around every now and then until golden crispy brown.</li>
        <li>Transfer to wax paper and enjoy with your favourite dipping sauce!</li>
    </ol>
