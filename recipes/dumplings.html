    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil to fry 12-14 pieces</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Meat Filling</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb ground pork </li>
        <li>2 cup garlic chives finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 tbsp regular soy sauce regular kind (not light or dark)</li>
        <li>½ tbsp white granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp cornstarch</li>
        <li>4 tbsp water</li>
        <li>2 tbsp sesame oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Dumpling Wrapper</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 ½ cup hot boiling water</li>
        <li>½ tsp salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Dipping Sauce</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp regular soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Chinese black vinegar</li>
        <li>½ tsp sesame oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, mix the Filling ingredients together. Mix very well until it forms a paste. The meat should be broken down and pasty.</li>
        <li>In another large mixing bowl, whisk flour and salt together. Pour hot boiling water into the dry ingredients. Then mix together until it forms a clumpy ball. If the dough is too sticky to work with, sprinkle a few more tablespoons of flour over top and knead it into a ball until it's no longer sticky.</li>
        <li>Flour your working surface. Then pierce a hole into the middle of the dough ball. Then shape it into a very loose circular "hoop". The hoop should be 1.5 inches thick.</li>
        <li>Cut the hoop in half to form two long pieces.</li>
        <li>Then slice those into 1 inch wide pieces or until you have 50 equal sized pieces.</li>
        <li>Roll each piece into a ball. Place the balls back into the mixing bowl and cover them with a moist clean towel so they do not dry out.</li>
        <li>Re-flour your surface and roll out one ball at a time with a rolling pin until thin. The wrappers should be about 3 inches wide in diameter.</li>
        <li>Fill your wrapper with a levelled off tablespoon of filling.</li>
        <li>Dab a little bit of water on the edges of the wrapper. Then fold one side over and pinch edges together to seal it.</li>
        <li>Then fold & pinch the edge to create a classic looking dumpling.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>To cook dumplings</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a hot non-stick pan set over medium heat, add oil. Lay your dumplings bottom side down. Pour enough water to cover the base of the pan. Cover with a lid.</li>
        <li>Steam cook for 12-13 minutes. In the last minute, remove the lid and let any excess water (if any) evaporate so the bottoms of the dumplings can crisp up.</li>
        <li>Serve with dipping sauce.</li>
    </ol>
